Had challenges with YouTube.  Used the 1150 Mac in lobby to do Bronze Challenge & it was constantly buffering
	Problem me or YouTube????

Was to do work in Repl.it, but there was something to turn off to succeed.

You Tube Video is 20.52 and had not sound - only visual.

		Did the Hello World exercise [our library _02_HelloWorld
	
	Create Custom Package (instead of default one)
		Define main function = in public static void -----
		
	Create Class that will contain main methods (the runnable one).
